#### Tell us a little bit about your background and where are you from well as your schooling like?
> I’m originally from the Western Suburbs of Chicago. I attended St Thomas in St Paul Minnesota where I studied Geological Engineering. I moved back to Chicago after that and during that time I kind of have a weird path, especially to how I got to where I'm at today. A family friend asked me to do analytics for his company. He's like “Hey, you can look for your other jobs, while you're doing this.” It sounded good to me! A week into the job they asked if I had done any computer programming. I had taken one class in college, it was something that was very unfamiliar to me. I said if they wanted me to try, I'll go ahead and I'll do my best. I taught myself SQL via YouTube tutorials. And I built out a sequel database for hospital providers to find recent medicare bad debts, and after that transferred into a consulting role. I began working with multiple clients and in different roles, from Mobile Applications to even sitting on the opposite side of Pre-Sales. Going through Technology Evaluations for one of the customers I was working with. Eventually, I moved into a Pre-Sales role and I honestly couldn't be happier. As soon as I learned about the role it was like the light bulb went off above my head. I thought “this is exactly what I need to be doing.” Every step along the way, I was unsure of what the next step was. Then as soon as my friend introduced me to Pre-Sales, it was like yeah, this is it!

>We had been good friends for a while and we kept in contact, we went to college together for about a year before he went on to another college. We stayed in contact that entire time, and so we went out and caught up for some dinner one night in Chicago. He was asking me what I was currently doing and I described my role in the projects I had been working on. He said what I am doing today is super transferable into what we call sales engineering, or you know Solutions Engineering. He suggested I look it up and tell him if it's something I’m interested in. As I began to dig into I realized this is amazing. This is exactly what I need to do. Doing the technology evaluations for one of the customers I was working for. I didn't know that the person presenting and giving the Demo was an actual role within an organization. I thought that was just somebody that had been with the company for a while. And they said, “Hey you know you're good at presenting you know the product.” I didn't know that was an actual career path you could walk. My friend we just having this organic conversation, he said, “I've worked with some of those guys I just didn't know, it was the thing.” I did some more research, and like I said. As soon as I start reading up about I’m like this is exactly what I need to be doing. Then, funny enough, I was on LinkedIN one day. My friend had liked a post from James Kiakis. I thought to myself, Oh man I should join this group, I should start getting in contact with these people. I asked my friend if I should reach out to James and he said “For sure, I used to work with him.” Then I joined the Pre-Sales collective and that was a really big help in getting this first opportunity.

#### How long have you been in Pre-Sales?
> I have been in Pre-Sales since the tail end of November 2020. I’m actually finishing up a seven-month training program with Oracle NetSuite. I’m finishing up a seven-month training program to be a Solution Consultant for NetSuite and actually going live within two weeks.

#### Have you noticed anything within pre-sales that you think could use a bump, a shift, or change?
> I think the number one thing is to continue spreading awareness about Pre-Sales. As I've mentioned, having sat on the opposite side of the table. And at the time not truly understanding what that process is, I think just spreading awareness is like a very big thing. There are tons of people that would be interested in roles within Pre-Sales. They just don't even know that they exist quite frankly. So I think that starts the first kickoff, getting people introduced to the role. In listening to the podcast you hear a lot of people mention the same thing. It's the best job nobody has ever heard about. In my short career here with Pre-Sales, I very much agree nobody knows about it. So yes, spreading that awareness is a big thing. As I've gone through training, I think one of the biggest things that you can do within presenting your demos is the storytelling aspect. It’s so much more than: “Here's our product, Here's how we can solve your challenges.” It's really playing the part of what’s possible. How can you use our program to fit your organization, how can we solve those challenges? And where can you go? Not only today in the short term, but in the long term future as well

#### Do you have any ideas on how more awareness can be brought to our wonderful role?
> I think it really starts with the Pre-Sales collective. Honestly, I think that's the big catalyst to get more people introduced to this sort of role.  Even since I joined the Pre-Sales Collective in February 2020. I can see how much the organization has grown in that short period of time. You see more and more people on Slack. Which, after seeing things starting to open up is just great to see. So I do think the Pre-Sales Collective is big and I also think it just comes from our internal members continuing to promote on LinkedIn and having conversations with your friends and other people that you meet in your network. You explain to them exactly what you do, and spread more awareness because it’s one of those things that not a lot of people have heard about too much.



#### What sort of advice do you have for those that are trying to break into Pre-Sales?
> I would say the biggest thing for me was speaking it into existence. I learned about the role in February of 2020. Like I said the light bulb went off that this is exactly what I need to be doing. I started applying for jobs and the COVID Pandemic begins. Finding a job during this time was very challenging it was not something that was not easy. Additionally, I was also making a career switch from Technical Consulting to Pre-Sales. A lot of the feedback I got from the interview processes was; “Well, you don't have any direct experience working as a Sales Engineer as a Solutions Consultant.” That was extremely frustrating because it's I knew I could do this, I can learn your product, I can do this.  The number one thing that ultimately led to me getting a job in Pre-Sales was using the Pre-Sales Slack channels. The Virtual Coffees were huge and those led me to do more networking and really meeting some very interesting people. Ultimately, every person I have met so far very much wants to help the next person out, because it’s the best job nobody's ever heard about. Thus as soon as you learn about Pre-Sales you want to share your knowledge. Now as I was going through those interview cycles, being able to speak to the conversations I was having with those different people within the organization. Was helping me in the interview process, because I was really able to understand you know what we were trying to accomplish as Sales Engineers from having those different conversations. That’s why I say networking is a really big thing. Also, I'm a really big believer and speaking things into the universe. I remember you know going out to my balcony in Chicago. And I just started speaking it out there. I want a new job, I need a role as a Solution Consultant. Then as I met new people as well I was really explained to them. Here's what I currently do. Here's what I want to do. Believe it or not, that's how I ended up Netsuite. My neighbor came over for a drink one night. We were talking and I told her; here's what I’m doing but here's exactly what I want to do. It turned out she knew somebody over at NetSuite and you know these things tend to work out. So you can speak into existence. That was huge because you start getting this belief in yourself. It was really what kept me going through the process as well because I was hearing back from so many organizations; “You don't have the experience, you don't have experience.” It is so easy to get down on yourself the more and more you continue to hear rejection. It can become easy to say; “I guess this isn't what I’m supposed to do. Maybe in a couple of years, I could do this right.”  But no matter what was happening through those processes I kept that same positive mindset. This is exactly what I’m supposed to be doing. I kept thinking back to that conversation I had with my friend at dinner when that light bulb went off, and the feeling that I had. This is my path, this is the journey I’m supposed to be on. All these rejections are part of the journey as well.  It just is what it is, you got to go through if you want to be a part of this role, the best job nobody's ever heard about. You're going to have to work for it. So I absolutely work for it. That first day when I got this opportunity. I went on my balcony and I was screaming with my hands over my head. I like to think back to a movie, The Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith. At the end of the movie when he comes out clapping, that's exactly how I felt..

#### What tools or skills have you found are invaluable to you?
> I think the biggest challenge is always time management. We’re extremely busy with our training. We're constantly learning new functionality, working towards goals, and simulating what the sales calls are going to be like. Managing your time and managing your schedules is a very big piece of the job, in my opinion. Also, it's a technical role, so you need a good technical base to always fall back on during different technical conversations.  But also framing them in a way that's going to appeal to somebody that's in business. Coming from technical consulting, I worked with a few different developers. When we would talk with the C suite, you can't necessarily get into the subject of refresh tokens and access tokens, right. You have to frame it in a way that's going to make sense for the C suite. The ability to understand the technology and mold that into a way for everybody to understand, but there’s still that technical flair. That’s how they know, this is truly a trusted advisor for us and this guy knows what he's talking about.

#### What are your hobbies outside of your career?
> I love working out and staying active. That's such a major piece for me. I come from an athletic background, I played basketball in college for a few years. So staying active it's a huge thing for me as I wake up every morning workout. I like to listen to music, going to concerts I'm looking forward to Covid restrictions beginning to lighten up, to get back to seeing concerts. What I’m really looking forward to the most is the Chicago Bears Football Season. I'm a season ticket holder and I've been going to games since I could quite literally crawl. Thus In this past year, not being able to go to any games was driving me insane. So i'm really excited to get back to the stadium to watch my Bears play and I wanna see our new quarterback, I'm excited about that. I think the new Quarterback, Justin Fields, we drafted is going to lead us to the promised land. At end of the day, it all starts with that quarterback and I finally feel for the first time in a long time that we may potentially have that franchise quarterback. I also eventually want to get back into voice acting as a hobby.  A couple of years ago I was taking a voice acting class. I really like doing it. It would be great to create different voices, different stories. My dream is one day to be the voice of cartoon characters and that would really be IT!

>So I'm starting to speak Voice Acting more into the universe, that's a big part of my mantra. I’m trying to speak that out to more and more people that I interact with. Maybe at some point, like someone will say, “I know this guy” or you know, whatever the case may be; just speaking into existence.

#### Are you currently living in the city suburbs, where are you?
> I just moved out to Denver, Colorado about three months ago. This role I accepted with NetSuite back in November included the expectation that I had to move out here to Denver. I worked on, getting renters for my condo and in about mid-march, I moved out here to Denver. It's been a change and I honestly never thought I would be Chicago. I love this city so much and it's where my life has been at. But I wanted to move into Pre-Sales so ultimately leaving Chicago is going to have to be part of it. Denver is a new opportunity and I’m enjoying it so far. This summer I started to golf with some of my work buddies here. You're outside, the beautiful scenery with the mountains in the background, and it's been pretty great so far.

#### What are the things that you love about living in Chicago?
> I love everything, I love the hustle and the bustle of the city. One of the things that I love the most is everybody has that mindset, you know like I gotta get from place A to B, and just have that hustle-type mentality in the city. I also love that it's such a diverse area, that you get so many great opportunities to meet and interact with so many different people. And, as someone who is definitely an extrovert and really enjoys meeting new people, that's one of my favorite things about the city because you're meeting so many different people, from different walks of life and there's so much that you can learn from other people. Chicago really is that giant melting pot, and just offers all that sort of potential there.

#### When you come back for a couple of days to visit friends or family, what old haunts are you going to visit?
> Well, the number one thing would be tailgating at Soldier Field. But there's a great Costa Rican restaurant in Bucktown called Irazu that’s amazing. I think it's one of the best food places in the entire city. It’s one of my favorite places to eat at. So I would recommend it to anybody visiting Chicago, that would be a spot. Once I'm back in the city that will be one of the first places I’m going. I really like Small Cheval, that's awesome really great food there. Barwise, I lived in Old Town for a few years, so I love just walking up and down Wells Steet, jumping from bar to bar, you can always get together with a few friends. Keep everybody on their toes by saying, “Alright, we're going to wrap up here we're going to the next one!”
